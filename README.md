## Introduction

The SELinux Notebook is an Open Source book on SELinux, originally created by
[Richard Haines](mailto:richard_c_haines@btinternet.com) and donated to the
SELinux community.  The Notebook's goal is to be the most current and
comprehensive book on SELinux, covering the Linux Kernel components, the
userspace libraries and tools, the policy toolchain, and the policy itself.

The SELinux Notebook is freely available, and contributions from the community
are welcome and encouraged!

## Viewing the Notebook Offline

While The SELinux Notebook is a living book which is constantly updated, we do
occasionally make new releases with pre-built versions in a variety of formats
that can be downloaded and read offline.  Our release page has more
information on each release, as well as the pre-built Notebooks:

## Build Your Own SELinux Notebook

The [**BUILD.md**](BUILD.md) file has more information on building HTML, PDF
and EPUB versions of the notebook as well as alternate ways to view the
source markdown. Note that the EPUB build will optionally produce a version
suitable for viewing on a Kindle that supports the "azw3" file format.
